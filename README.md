# Production-Schedule

The aim of this project is to optimize the bottling process of a winery to meet increasing demand, and minimize the holding cost of bottled wine. One of the main challenges in wine production is logistics. Indeed, different wines have different production processes due to specific aging and maturing required for each wine as wine gains complexity and taste with good aging conditions (humidity, temperature, material). These intricacies lead to scarcity of space as aging and inventory both consume space. Based on data of the last 10 years, the trends of the demand of the respective products was studied and based on a forecast made by the winery, we could estimate that by 2025 the demand will reach 4 million bottles per year compared to 3.2 bottles in 2016. With this increase in demand, the restricted inventory, and the current scheduling technics, the bottling line would be a bottleneck to the production. Our challenge is to create an annual schedule for the bottling process of 2025 based on the forecasted demand. Indeed, with the current condition of production and inventory, it would be impossible to reach the 2025 goals without implementing some changes in the production scheduling.
